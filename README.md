# Satellite Visualisation Dashboard

A Landsat-8 satellite image explorer dashboard. Satellites take images of our planet in various electromagnetic spectrums like UV, Near Infrared, Short Wave Infrared along with RGB. By displaying the intensities of these spectrums in our RGB displays, we can visualise the changes in landform over a period of years. I got to learn a lot about remote sensing and using Google Earth Engine while doing this project. The project has been created using Landsat 8 image collection from Google Earth Engine, Python for processing the images and IPyWidgets to convert the Jupyter notebooks to applications.

To test the dashboard, click on the link in the repo about section. For best results, search for the "Ucayali River" and draw a rectangle over the river on the map. Then select "SWIR1/NIR/RED" in the RGB combo. It'll show the change in the river basin over the given period.
